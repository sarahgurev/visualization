				<figcaption>
				We begin with a univariate analysis of the units, population, and ownership rates across neighborhoods (average across years). The neighborhoods are sorted by average total number of units. The neighborhood names are all names I would expect and recognize (except for Mattapan which I had never heard of before, but now know is a neighborhood with primarily Caribbean and African American roots that is part of Dorchestor - and is in fact the Native American name for the Dorchestor area). By showing the information with respect to both neighborhoods and zip codes, it becomes clear that some neighborhoods correspond to multiple zip codes and some neighborhoods do not have any zip code listed (though no individual zip code corresponds to more than one neighborhood). We also see the total number of units differs drastically across neighborhoods, so any analysis of vacant units should consider fraction of vacancies relative to the total number of units in that neighborhood. Unlike the great differences between vacant unit and total unit, we see that total units is roughly proportional to the total population across neighborhoods.

				<figcaption>
				We look also at an univariate analysis when we consider to consider what years data is available for. Ownership rates data is available for all of the past 20 years. It becomes immediately evident that census data (unit and population data) is only collected once, rather than being available per year. I tried to find what year the census data was collected in the metadata, and was unfortunately unable to do so. With the columns sorted by year, we can also immediately see a trend of increase over time with respect to average corporate ownership rates (across neighborhoods) and perhaps a slight decrease in average owner occupancy rate over time. This also gives us a hint as to a potential trade off between corporate ownership rates and owner occupancy rates, which I would expect.

				<figcaption>
				Now we can see South Boston Waterfront and Downtown have the most vacancies when considering frac_vacancy (number of vacanct units/ total number of units) -- way more than expected at around 1 in 5 units vacant. Before looking only at vacant unit, Roxburry and Dorchestor stood out, but we can see now they are average in terms of their fraction vacant units relative to the total number of units.

				<img src="Owner Occupancy Rate and Corporate Ownership Rate over time (by Neighborhood).png" alt="" style="width: 55vw; min-width: 330px;"/>
				<figcaption>
				As hinted at in the univariate analyses, there is a strong trend showing an increase in corporate ownership rates over time, that we can now see is consistent across all neighborhoods. On the other hand, there is no strong trend for owner occupancy rates over time - though there are a few neighborhoods with a slight decrease over time (i.e., Brighton and West End). Most of the rest of the neighborhoods are largely constant over time with respect to owner occupancy rate, though we can see South Boston Waterfront varies greatly over time, though with no overall increase or decrease (South Boston Waterpark also varies periodically with respect to corporate ownership rate, though there is still an upwards trend over time). Moreover, we can again begin to see a tradeoff between owner occupancy rate and corporate ownership rate, where neighborhoods with among the lowest owner occupancy rate (Fenway and Longwood) are among the highest in terms of corporate ownership rate (across all time periods).

				<img src="Corporate ownership rate vs. Owner occupancy rate across neighborhoods (average across all years).png" alt="" style="width: 55vw; min-width: 330px;"/>
				<figcaption>
				We can now see the very clear relationship between corporate ownership and owner occupancy, as neighborhoods with larger average corporate ownership rates (across years) clearly have lower owner occupancy rates.

				<figcaption>
				When drilling into the neighborhood seen above with periodic variation in both corporate ownership and owner occupancy rates over time (South Boston Waterfront), suprisingly we do not see the same relation between rates over time as we do across neighborhoods. Lower corporate ownership rates do not necessarily lead to higher owner occupancy rates. However, we can see that the point with low corporate ownership rates and low owner occupancy rates are all from the first 5 years.

				<img src="Corporate ownership rate vs. Owner occupancy rate across years (South Boston Waterfront, 2009-2024).png" alt="" style="width: 55vw; min-width: 330px;"/>
				<figcaption>
				We can see the trend between corporate ownership rates and owner occupancy rates in South Boston Waterfront returns when we consider only the period from 2009 onward. There are also some clusters of years with similar values (all of the most recent years from 2020 onwards are the highest in corporate ownership and lowest in owner occupancy, greatly contributing to but not the only reason for the overall negative trend), though sequential years are more mixed prior to 2020.

				I calculated a fraction non-white, which corresponds to 1 - fraction of white population over total population (Note: this value does not change much when considering only population over 18). This allows me to investigate the relationship between occupancy rates in neighborhoods and their racial make up. As census data is only collected once, and we can't look at changes over time, I therefore use the maximum ownership rates over time for each neighborhood. I found that as the fraction of non-white population increases in a neighborhood, the corporate ownership decreases (and owner occupancy rate slightly increases, though this does not seem to be as significant of a trend). In order to understand this, I took a look also at the relationship between population density (total population / total units) and the fraction of a non-white population. We can see a clear trend between increased density and increased fraction non-white. This could hint that it is actually density is actually more related to corporate ownership rate. Note that Longwood is a significant outlier in terms of density with over 8 people per units, leading me to distrust their census data as it relates to individual housing units, and I have therefore excluded Longwood from this plot.

				<figcaption>
				There is in fact a clear relationship between density and corporate ownership, as density increases across neighborhoods, corporate ownership rate decreases (I continue to use the maximum across years). Fenway however does not fit this trend, with one of the highest densities and one of the highest corporate ownerships. (Note I continue to exclude Longwood as above)

				I now explore the factors related to fraction vacancy. Unsurprisingly, more dense areas have a lower fraction of vacant units. Areas with more vacancies also have lower owner occupancy rates and higher corporate ownership rates. (Note I continue to exclude Longwood as above)

				Lastly, I explore how vacancy relates to geography. From the univariate analysis, we know that some neighborhoods are lacking zip codes.

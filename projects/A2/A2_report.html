				<figcaption>
				We begin with a univariate analysis of the units, population, and ownership rates across neighborhoods (average across years). The neighborhoods are sorted by average total number of units. The neighborhood names are all names I would expect and recognize (except for Mattapan which I had never heard of before, but now know is a neighborhood with primarily Caribbean and African American roots that is part of Dorchestor - and is in fact the Native American name for the Dorchestor area). By showing the information with respect to both neighborhoods and zip codes, it becomes clear that some neighborhoods correspond to multiple zip codes and some neighborhoods do not have any zip code listed (though no individual zip code corresponds to more than one neighborhood). We also see the total number of units differs drastically across neighborhoods, so any analysis of vacant units should consider fraction of vacancies relative to the total number of units in that neighborhood. Unlike the great differences between vacant unit and total unit, we see that total units is roughly proportional to the total population across neighborhoods.

				We look also at an univariate analysis when we consider to consider what years data is available for. Ownership rates data is available for all of the past 20 years. It becomes immediately evident that census data (unit and population data) is only collected once, rather than being available per year. I tried to find what year the census data was collected in the metadata, and was unfortunately unable to do so. With the columns sorted by year, we can also immediately see a trend of increase over time with respect to average corporate ownership rates (across neighborhoods) and perhaps a slight decrease in average owner occupancy rate over time. This also gives us a hint as to a potential trade off between corporate ownership rates and owner occupancy rates, which I would expect.

				<figcaption>
				As hinted at in the univariate analyses, there is a strong trend showing an increase in corporate ownership rates over time, that we can now see is consistent across all neighborhoods. On the other hand, there is no strong trend for owner occupancy rates over time - though there are a few neighborhoods with a slight decrease over time (i.e., Brighton and West End). Most of the rest of the neighborhoods are largely constant over time with respect to owner occupancy rate, though we can see South Boston Waterfront varies greatly over time, though with no overall increase or decrease (South Boston Waterpark also varies periodically with respect to corporate ownership rate, though there is still an upwards trend over time). Moreover, we can again begin to see a tradeoff between owner occupancy rate and corporate ownership rate, where neighborhoods with among the lowest owner occupancy rate (Fenway and Longwood) are among the highest in terms of corporate ownership rate (across all time periods).

				<figcaption>
				We can now see the very clear relationship between corporate ownership and owner occupancy, as neighborhoods with larger average corporate ownership rates (across years) clearly have lower owner occupancy rates.

				<figcaption>
				When drilling into the neighborhood seen above with periodic variation in both corporate ownership and owner occupancy rates over time (South Boston Waterfront), suprisingly we do not see the same relation between rates over time as we do across neighborhoods. Lower corporate ownership rates do not necessarily lead to higher owner occupancy rates. However, we can see that the point with low corporate ownership rates and low owner occupancy rates are all from the first 5 years.

				We can see the trend between corporate ownership rates and owner occupancy rates in South Bostno Waterfront returns when we consider only the period from 2009 onward.

				We begin with a univariate analysis of the units, population, and ownership rates across neighborhoods (average across years). The neighborhoods are sorted by average total number of units. By showing the information with respect to both neighborhoods and zip codes, it becomes clear that some neighborhoods correspond to multiple zip codes and some neighborhoods do not have any zip code listed (though no individual zip code corresponds to more than one neighborhood). We also see the total number of units differs drastically across neighborhoods, so any analysis of vacant units should consider fraction of vacancies relative to the total number of units in that neighborhood. Unlike the great differences between vacant unit and total unit, we see that total units is roughly proportional to the total population across neighborhoods.

				We look also at an univariate analysis when we consider to consider what years data is available for. It becomes immediately evident that census data (unit and population data) is only collected once, rather than being available per year. I tried to find what year the census data was collected in the metadata, and was unfortunately unable to do so. With the columns sorted by year, we can also immediately see a trend of increase over time with respect to average corporate ownership rates (across neighborhoods) and perhaps a slight decrease in average owner occupancy rate over time. This also gives us a hint as to a potential trade off between corporate ownership rates and owner occupancy rates.

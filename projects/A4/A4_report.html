    <h2>Proposition: Global warming has had a great negative impact over the last 20 years.</h2>

      <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

      <figure>

				<figcaption>
					A wave of sea level rise - a stacked area graph showing the rise in change in mean sea levels (mm) across seas. 
					The increase in the maximum year-averaged change in sea level rise for a particular sea over the previous max value up to the previous year is colored by the year in which the increase occurs. 
					The increase across all years (and so total height for each sea) represents the difference between the maximum and minimum change in year-averaged sea level for that sea. 
					The years appear in order, so the cumulative increased change in sea level rise (in lighter blues to white) over the past 20 years can be seen.

				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>RATIONALE_1</li> 2 My ultimate goal was to create an engaging figure that draws viewers into it- I therefore made all my design choices around "looking like a wave". 
				As a society we are inundated with information overload about climate change, so my goal was to show something that is visually different to get people interested and
				 want to talk and share about this issue. I therefore started out this plot with the goal of making a wave effect - a wave that is increasing over time - to give viewers 
				 the sense of motion and action, that something is coming. This wave shape is facilated by a streamplot - with colors for each year ordered from earlier years (with smaller changes in mean sea level) in darker blue to later years in lighter blue to almost white. 
				 The white of a wave represents a turbulent motion - the wave is about to crash. This makes the visualization both engaging and persuasive, that there is a great negative impact
				 to climate change over the past 20 years, and implies without saying it explicitly that this is a problem that will continue to worsen. I wasn't sure if I needed the colorbar for the years, or if the labels
				 for the years on the right were sufficient to get people to understand the different colors represented different years over time - but then figured the colorbar doesn't detract from the overall image and if it makes people understand faster what is happening then that is better. I wanted a single chart that alone carried the impact of climate change - without needing to expand on all of the other impacts it is having on the world to convince viewers of the large negative impact. 
				<li>RATIONALE_2</li> 2 I chose a black backgroun with white text because it is likewise unique and engaging. Both the color and the grid appearing behind the streamplot are designed to make 
				the wave feel like it is literally coming out of the page to splash the viewer. I'd started out with a "normal" white background for the figure - and the wave just didn't pop out of the page as much as it does on black (I would ultimately have to consider the final destination for the image in another setting, 
				i.e., if it was intended to be included in a book printed, the black background would not be as ideal). I also didn't originally have the grid (since I normally find grid lines distracting - and appreciate the story blank space on a figure tells) - but here with the wave already popping so much out of the page- the 
				grid only serves to increase the 3D effect, with it in the background of the figure. 
				<li>RATIONALE_3</li> 2 The title again likewise refers to the wave, while highlighting the fact that it is an increased change in sea level that is currently happening. This title and the annotated 
				20 year increase on the side are there to stress the fact that climate change is in fact increasing- and that this should be the takeaway. I think this title and labels worked well, though I considered a larger, more descriptive title I felt
				that this was more engaging. I also considered adding a source to the plot, but ultimately decided against needing it. 
				<li>RATIONALE_4</li> 2 The data transformation to facilitate this wave appearance was complicated, and I tried many different transformations in attempt to achieve both clarity for the viewer as well as get the proper sense of increase over time. 
				I wanted each year to represent the increase in maximum change - so that a new color would only show in the case of an increase (to get the wave effect). I also wanted the total to be meaningful (i.e. I did not want for each year to be the full height of that year's change in sea level, as that would not make sense summed across years). Instead the increase across all years (and so total height for each sea) represents the difference between the maximum and minimum change in year-averaged sea level for that sea. 
				The years appear in order, so the cumulative increased change in sea level rise (in lighter blues to white) over the past 20 years can be seen. 
				Therefore, I computed the maximum for a given sea up to each year and then differences between years. I wanted this tranformation to be hidden however, for it to appear simple and obvious to the viewer (even though something complicated was happening underneath). This was difficult as already change in sea level 
				is a difficult concept to grasp (as opposed to sea level where the total height could then always be the total height up to a given year when that year represents an increase over the previous maximum). I'd considered taking an arbitrary start at 0, and using the changes in 
				sea level to compute sea level value instead of continuing with the change in sea level. However, these numbers become large and harder I believe to understand the scale (and starting with an arbitrary 0 height is confusing, and add another layer of abstraction for the viewers to understand).

      <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

      <figure>

				<figcaption>
          		Minimum annual surface temperature change across countries relative to a 20-year average change. Far from global warming occuring, the change in surface temperature has been flat, and is even decreasing over the past year.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>RATIONALE_1</li> -2 The most deceptive aspect of this plot is the underlying data transformations. It is weird and unexpected to be considering 
				the minimum yearly change in temperature, people would typically expect an average. I toyed for a while with the idea that I didn't even have to label the y-axis with 
				"minimum" - that I could just let viewers assume what the transformation was. After all, if I had done the mean, not everyone would label it as "mean" (as people usually assume 
				any aggregation is a mean). However, I decided it was too obviously deceptive to not include the label "minimum". Moreover, climate change is best viewed on large time scales, and while we just so happened to have ended
				on a year with a lower minimum temperature, a single year value is NOT a trend.
				<li>RATIONALE_2</li> -2 The choice of the past 20 years is however the largest deception, more so than the choice of minimum. If the plot had been allowed to continue 
				earlier in time, viewers could have seen that there has in fact been a large increased change over time (even when considering the minimum rather than the average value). In order to make it clear
				that there hasn't been a large increase, I then recalculated the y-axis with respect to the 20-year average - so there was a new 0 value (otherwise all numbers would have been high above 0, and it would 
				be clear an increase had happened). It makes it seem like things have been mostly flat (instead of increasing), with that little note on the end that if it's not flat, it is even decreasing! There is no question therefore that this choice was absolutely deceptive. Moreover, 20 years is large enough that it is attempting to deceive a viewer that is a large enough scale to see change (a viewer wouldn't believe for instance 2 or 5 years is large enough to expect an increase, but 20 seems large). 
				<li>RATIONALE_3</li> 2 To belie the fact that the underlying choices of data transformation and scale were deceptive, I then attempted to make every other design choice as simple and straightforward as possible.
				This would encourage viewers to believe nothing untoward was happening - because there is nowhere to hide in a simple line graph. Therefore, I stuck with a very simple single line graph as the only value plotted on this graph. 
				To add dramatic flourish, as if to say 'not only is global warming not a thing, we could even be experiencing global cooling, so how can we trust climate change' - I add the arrow signal to the end of the final point on 
				the line graph and color the final downward line blue. It should only take one chart to convince a climate change skeptic climate change isn't real, and isn't having a large negative effect (I just focused on the primary outcome thought of, literally global warming, and turned it on its head). I toyed between including and not including - would people believe this is a real data point - but I added the annotation of the drop to make it clear it is real. I was also unsure
				if people might believe the new color is a result of the end points being predictions instead of real data (or some other thing being different, rather than just a highlighting of that point), but I believe the annotation helps solidify it.
				I belive the simpleness of this graph helps persuade the viewer there is nothing to hide. 
				<li>RATIONALE_4</li> 2 I kept the title and annotation straightforward, but engaging. The axis and the average line are well labeled. Nothing complicated is going on, everything is clean and neat, including limited grid lines and limited ticks. The logo of the data source is displayed prominently. All of these choices help give credence to
				the idea that there is nothing to hide.

      <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

      <p>Rather than on the visualizations themselves, I used deception in the hidden, underlying data transformations. 
		This avoids there being any clear "gotchas" where overlapping lines or other clear visualization faults can be easily pointed out.
		 Instead, I strived to make my deceptive visualization as straightforward as possible, as if to say its so clean there can't possible be any bodies buried there. 
		Yet, once these deceptive choices have been made in the underlying data transformation and limits, 
		  it poisons the later "earnest" choices, making them fruit of a poisonous tree and it becomes impossible 
		  to separate what is deceptive and what is earnest. </p>
		
		  <p>It surprised me how easy it was to create a deceptive data tranformation that fit what I knew to be climate change skeptic rhetoric - 
			the idea that climate scientists don't know what they are talking about, it used to be global cooling, now its warming, what is it really? 
			I would have thought I would have needed to try many different possible transformation (and much more complicated ones involving certain points
			 left out or other such deceptive tactics), but I surprisingly didn't. By simply showing the last 20 years instead of a larger time scale (where 
			 effects are more meaningful when considering large time periods), and us by chance having a decrease in the past year when considering the minimum 
			 temperature, I was easily able to craft a deceptive narrative with limited forcing of the data. 
			 
			 I consider it misleading to make design choices greatly 
			 outside of what is expected to espouse a certain point of view (minimum rather than mean) and to choose arbitrary thresholds. Normally I think of hidden
			 thresholds in terms of data binning (as this isn't even visible on a plot the way axis limits are), but I now believe purposely chosen axis limits 
			 (despite the limits not being hidden) but chosen to hide a different trend outside of those limits (an increase over time that is hidden when looking 
			 only at a 20 year time scale) is equally damaging. 20 years is large enough that it 
			 is attempting to deceive a viewer that is a large enough scale to see change (a viewer wouldn't believe for instance 2 or 5 years is large enough to 
			 expect an increase, but 20 seems large). Neither of these choices even approach acceptable design decisions.   </p>

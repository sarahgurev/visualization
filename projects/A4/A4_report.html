      <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

				<figcaption>
					A wave of sea level rise - a stacked area graph showing the rise in change in mean sea levels (mm) across seas. 
					The increase in the maximum year-averaged change in sea level rise for a particular sea over the previous max value up to the previous year is colored by the year in which the increase occurs. 
					The increase across all years (and so total height for each sea) represents the difference between the maximum and minimum change in year-averaged sea level for that sea. 
					The years appear in order, so the cumulative increased change in sea level rise (in lighter blues to white) over the past 20 years can be seen.

			<ul>
				<li>RATIONALE_1</li> 2 I wanted to be engaging - I made by design choices around "looking like a wave" - to get people interested and want to talk and share about this issue.

          		Minimum annual surface temperature change across countries relative to a 20-year average change. Far from global warming occuring, the change in surface temperature is decreasing over the past year.

      <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

      <p>[WRITE FINAL REFLECTION PARAGRAPHS HERE.]</p>
	  Once these deceptive choices have been made in the underlying data transformation and limits, 
	  it poisons the later "earnest" choices, making them fruit of a poisonous tree and it becomes impossible 
	  to separate what is deceptive and what is earnest.

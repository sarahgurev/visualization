					Exploring how the old age dependency ratio (ratio of old age population to working population) has changed between 1900 and 2000, especially dependent on what the minimum age is to transition from the working population to the old age population. The elderly population is an almost three times greater fraction of the working population in 2000 than in 1900 when considering old age to begin at 65. WHere the old age dependency ratio used to be relatively flat depending on minimum age, there are now in 2000 a much greater fraction of elderly at lower ages. The working population is condered to be from age 25 to the minimum elderly age.

				Design Rationale for Sketch 1:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>RATIONALE_1</li> I am interested in the burden of population aging, yet a direct comparison of the elderly population is not as informative as relative to the working population. I was hoping this would communicate the increased burden - with the significant white space between the lines between 1900 and 2000.
				<li>RATIONALE_2</li> This graph is however overcomplicated. The minimum age for old age is not intuitive and I think might detract from the overall question of just generally is there a greater burden between 1900 and 2000 - but without this axis I would just be comparing two numbers (the ratio in 1900 and the ratio in 2000 - which can't be a visualization alone). The viewer has to think too much about what is being represented, what a higher value means for the question. 
				<li>RATIONALE_3</li> The strength of this is that the ratio is interesting (and the two colors used between 1900 and 2000 show the clear difference). I'd however benefit from a visualization that more clearly shows the ratio visually.
			</ul>

			<h2>Phase One: Sketching Visualizations</h2>

      <figure>
				<img src="a3sketch1.png" alt="" style="width: 55vw; min-width: 330px;"/>
				<figcaption>
					Exploring how the old age dependency ratio (ratio of old age population to working population) has changed between 1900 and 2000, especially dependent on what the minimum age is to transition from the working population to the old age population. The elderly population is an almost three times greater fraction of the working population in 2000 than in 1900 when considering old age to begin at 65. WHere the old age dependency ratio used to be relatively flat depending on minimum age, there are now in 2000 a much greater fraction of elderly at lower ages. The working population is condered to be from age 25 to the minimum elderly age.

				Design Rationale for Sketch 1:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>RATIONALE_1</li> I am interested in the burden of population aging, yet a direct comparison of the elderly population is not as informative as relative to the working population. I was hoping this would communicate the increased burden - with the significant white space between the lines between 1900 and 2000.
				<li>RATIONALE_2</li> This graph is however overcomplicated. The minimum age for old age is not intuitive and I think might detract from the overall question of just generally is there a greater burden between 1900 and 2000 - but without this axis I would just be comparing two numbers (the ratio in 1900 and the ratio in 2000 - which can't be a visualization alone). The viewer has to think too much about what is being represented, what a higher value means for the question. 
				<li>RATIONALE_3</li> The strength of this is that the ratio is interesting (and the two colors used between 1900 and 2000 show the clear difference). I'd however benefit from a visualization that more clearly shows the ratio visually.
			</ul>


      <figure>

				<figcaption>
				Elderly (60-90+) are an increased percentage of total population in 2000 than in 1900, relative to working (20-60) and young (0-20) populations.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 2:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>RATIONALE_1</li> This is much simpler than 1 and much more understandable. We are not varying any other mostly extraneous category, and strictly having numbers shown that are very relevant to the question of increased burden of population aging. The percentages written out are very helpful for readability.
				<li>RATIONALE_2</li> It is not clear what quantities to compare, people will be only comparing 6% to 16% rather than any ratio.  
				<li>RATIONALE_3</li> It would be much better if the years were grouped together instead of the age categories (as any ratio requires looking across age categories within a given year).
			</ul>

	  <figure>
				<img src="a3sketch2.png" alt="" style="width: 55vw; min-width: 330px;"/>
				<figcaption>
         Population pyramid: size of populations in youth (0-20), working(20-60), and elderly (60-90+) category. The working population has a relatively greater burden of elderly population in 2000 than in 1900.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 3: 
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>RATIONALE_1</li> Now we can visually see the ratio between old and working populations, so this is much better than sketch 1. An old age dependency ratio instead of needing to be thought about to be interpreted is now visually evident. Color is used to distinguish between the two main categories of interest - elderly and working populations.
				<li>RATIONALE_2</li> A population pyramid is a classic way to represent this kind of data (which aids viewers comfort with interpreting), where the burden is clear of the the working population literaly supporting the weight of the different sizes of elderly populations.
				<li>RATIONALE_3</li> Viewers may be confused however at first glance what values should they be comparing, and might belive they should be directly comparing elderly between 1900 and 2000 rather than the two ratios. If I instead made it so the working population shape was the same size between 1900 and 2000 - then a comparison of elderly between 1900 and 2000 would be the same as a comparison between the ratios. They also need to look at the caption to see the age ranges for each category.

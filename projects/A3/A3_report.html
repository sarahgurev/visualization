			<h2>Phase One: Sketching Visualizations</h2>

      <figure>

				<figcaption>
					Exploring how the old age dependency ratio (ratio of old age population to working population) has changed between 1900 and 2000, especially dependent on what the minimum age is to transition from the working population to the old age population. The elderly population is an almost three times greater fraction of the working population in 2000 than in 1900 when considering old age to begin at 65. WHere the old age dependency ratio used to be relatively flat depending on minimum age, there are now in 2000 a much greater fraction of elderly at lower ages. The working population is condered to be from age 25 to the minimum elderly age.

				Design Rationale for Sketch 1:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>RATIONALE_1</li> I am interested in the burden of population aging, yet a direct comparison of the elderly population is not as informative as relative to the working population. I was hoping this would communicate the increased burden - with the significant white space between the lines between 1900 and 2000.
				<li>RATIONALE_2</li> This graph is however overcomplicated. The minimum age for old age is not intuitive and I think might detract from the overall question of just generally is there a greater burden between 1900 and 2000 - but without this axis I would just be comparing two numbers (the ratio in 1900 and the ratio in 2000 - which can't be a visualization alone). The viewer has to think too much about what is being represented, what a higher value means for the question. 
				<li>RATIONALE_3</li> The strength of this is that the ratio is interesting (and the two colors used between 1900 and 2000 show the clear difference). I'd however benefit from a visualization that more clearly shows the ratio visually.
			</ul>

				Elderly (60-90+) are an increased percentage of total population in 2000 than in 1900, relative to working (20-60) and young (0-20) populations.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 2:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>RATIONALE_1</li> This is much simpler than 1 and much more understandable. We are not varying any other mostly extraneous category, and strictly having numbers shown that are very relevant to the question of increased burden of population aging. I hope this clearly shows there is this increased burden of population aging in 2000 than in 1900, as seen with a much larger elderly bar. 
				<li>RATIONALE_2</li> The percentages written out are very helpful for readability, yet is not clear what quantities to compare, people will be only comparing 6% to 16% rather than any ratio.  
				<li>RATIONALE_3</li> It would be much better if the years were grouped together instead of the age categories (as any ratio requires looking across age categories within a given year).
			</ul>

	  <figure>
				<img src="a3sketch2.png" alt="" style="width: 55vw; min-width: 330px;"/>
				<figcaption>
         Population pyramid: size of populations in youth (0-20), working(20-60), and elderly (60-90+) category. The working population has a relatively greater burden of elderly population in 2000 than in 1900.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 3: 
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>RATIONALE_1</li> Now we can visually see the ratio between old and working populations, so this is much better than sketch 1. An old age dependency ratio instead of needing to be thought about to be interpreted is now visually evident. Color is used to distinguish between the two main categories of interest - elderly and working populations.
				<li>RATIONALE_2</li> A population pyramid is a classic way to represent this kind of data (which aids viewers comfort with interpreting), where the burden is clear of the the working population literaly supporting the weight of the different sizes of elderly populations. We'd better be able to see the pyramid if all of the 5 year age groups were shown - not just the three overall categories.
				<li>RATIONALE_3</li> Viewers may be confused however at first glance what values should they be comparing, and might belive they should be directly comparing elderly between 1900 and 2000 rather than the two ratios. If I instead made it so the working population shape was the same size between 1900 and 2000 - then a comparison of elderly between 1900 and 2000 would be the same as a comparison between the ratios. They also need to look at the caption to see the age ranges for each category.
			</ul>
			

      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>
        The pyramid sketch is by far the best - as it puts next to each other the aspects of the relevant ratio between elderly and working populations and allows for a quick visual comparison. This is much preferred over the first sketch (where the ratio is a number that is hard to understand) and the second sketch (where groupings put the elderly and working populations from the same year far apart). The pyramid also allows the burden of population aging to literally be felt as as the working population holding up the elderly population. The colors also in the pyramid are done the best with color being used to make the elderly population stand out (rather than a particular year). I will continue with a pyramid in the next phase, however I will incorporate the inclusion of percentages from sketch 2 into the pyramid. I will keep the coloring by population rather than by year, since there will be separate pyramids per year. To improve the pyramid, I will also keep the size of the working population constant (so comparing elderly is same as comparing the ratio), as well as though keeping colors constant for each of the three age groups show all of the individual age ranges.

			<h2>Design Process & Design Decisions</h2>

			<p>
        The story I trying to describe is 

		I use color and size as visual encodings. The sorting is important 
		Subtly, I rescale the sizes so that 
		This may obscure

      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>
       My sketches easily built on one another. Through sketch 1 I initially explored the idea of caring about how the ratio between elderly and working population changes between 1900 and 2000. However a numeric ratio is not informative, I instead wanted viewers to see the ratio. So, I switched to a bar chart with percentages (however, these are grouped the wrong way for understanding the dependency ratio). This led me to the pyramid (where elderly and working values for the same year are right next to each other) which I ultimately continue with in step 2, as this literally shows the burden of population aging and the dependency ratio, and allows for easy visual comparison of the right quantities. While I continued with the pyramid into phase 2, I adapted it with some of the ideas from the other sketches (including the percentage labels which allow viewers to compare sizes both visually and in detail as desired). I believe it worked well to use sketch 3 for the final design, though ultimately I believe new aspects to the pyramid provide significant impact beyond the original sketch. For instance, the sentence caption helps people understand what ratio is important and puts it into easy to think about terms.
